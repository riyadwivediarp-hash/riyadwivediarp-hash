NAME
       riya - a work-in-progress system optimized for problem solving

SYNOPSIS
       riya [--think] [--break] [--fix] [--repeat] <problem>

DESCRIPTION
       riya is an IT undergraduate at IIIT Bhopal, currently in
       Semester III. Primary function: decompose hard problems into
       smaller ones until they feel embarrassingly simple.

       Operates best between 10pm and 2am. May emit warning-level
       output when a solution is inelegant.

OPTIONS
       --think         Stares at the problem before touching keyboard.
                       Recommended. Often skipped by peers.

       --break         Intentional failure mode. Inputs edge cases,
                       breaks assumptions, stress-tests the logic.
                       Not a bug — this is the workflow.

       --fix           Traces root cause. Does not patch symptoms.

       --repeat        Loops until understood, not just until working.

       --help          You're reading it.

KNOWN BUGS
       - Occasionally over-engineers solutions
       - Explains time complexity to people who did not ask
       - Will rewrite code from scratch if it "feels wrong"

EXIT STATUS
       0   Problem solved and understood
       1   Problem solved but not understood (treated as failure)

SEE ALSO
       cppreference(1), codeforces(1), gdb(1)

The real trick with DSA isn't memorizing algorithms.
It's learning to see the shape of a problem before you
know its name. A graph problem doesn't announce itself.
A greedy solution doesn't come with a label.

You get there by breaking enough things to know
what they look like from the inside.
